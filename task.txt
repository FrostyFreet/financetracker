Phase 3: Implement Key Functionalities and UI Elements
    Transaction Form Component:

    Build a form component to let users add transactions (income or expense).
    Include fields for category, amount, date, and description.
    Set up state to handle form input and basic validation (e.g., check that amount is positive, date isn’t empty).
    Transaction List Component:

    Display a list of transactions (mock data for now) with options to edit or delete entries.
    Use conditional rendering to show different icons/colors for income and expenses.
    Transaction Management Logic:

    Add functions to handle adding, editing, and deleting transactions.
    Store the transactions in local storage or a global state (e.g., Redux or Context API) to persist them temporarily.
Phase 4: Data Visualization with Charts
    Monthly/Weekly Spending Chart:

    Use Chart.js or D3.js to create a bar or line chart showing expenses over time.
    Display weekly/monthly trends, with options to switch between time frames.
    Category-Based Spending:

    Add a pie or doughnut chart showing the percentage breakdown of expenses by category (e.g., food, rent).
    Fetch data from your global state to populate this chart dynamically.
    Savings Progress Chart:

    Create a progress bar or another type of chart that tracks savings against goals.
Phase 5: Advanced UI and State Management
    Set Up Global State (Redux/Context API):

    Integrate Redux or Context API to manage the state across components, making data updates available globally (e.g., transactions, budgets).
    This will allow seamless interaction between components and better data handling.
    Budget Goal Tracking and Alerts:

    Let users set budget limits per category.
    Implement a system that visually indicates if they are close to or exceeding these limits, using color changes or alerts.
    Filter and Search Functionality:

    Add filters for date, category, and amount ranges on the transaction list.
    Include a search bar to quickly find specific transactions.
Phase 6: Responsive Design and Accessibility
    Responsive Layout:

    Use CSS media queries and responsive units (like vh, vw, rem) to ensure your app looks good on both desktop and mobile.
    Ensure charts and form elements resize appropriately.
    Accessibility:

    Make sure elements are accessible by keyboard and readable by screen readers.
    Use semantic HTML elements (e.g., header, main, nav) to improve accessibility.
Phase 7: Testing and Refining
    Unit Testing:

    Use Jest and React Testing Library to test key components, like the transaction form and dashboard.
    Focus on critical functionalities, such as adding/editing transactions and rendering charts correctly.
    Final Touches:

    Add animations for smooth user interactions and page transitions.
    Refine CSS styling to make the app visually appealing and ensure a polished look.
    Documentation:

Write clear documentation for your components and functions, including instructions for any key configurations.
End Goal: A Complete Frontend Application
By the end, you’ll have a fully interactive, visually engaging finance tracker app that:

Looks professional and works smoothly on all devices.
Highlights your skills in state management, data visualization, and responsive design.
Can be expanded with a backend whenever you’re ready.
This approach will give you a project with real-world relevance and advanced features that can stand out in a portfolio!
